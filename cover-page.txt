## Assignment Questions

In a few sentences, what does PWM do, on a physical level? Can the Arduino 
actually output a voltage that is not 0 or 5 Volts?

It turns the LED on and off very rapidly (approx. 100 times per second), so 
that it tricks the eye into thinking the LED output is dimmer than full 
brightness. The Arduino cannot actually output anything but 0V and 5V.

In a few sentences, how does your program convert the input from `analogRead` 
into a voltage? Could you generalize this into an equation to get a voltage
given an `analogRead`?

The Arduino will map input voltages (as determined by the potentiometer) between 
0 and 5 volts and convert them into integer values between 0 and 1023. This yields 
a resolution between readings of 5V or 1024 units. You could determine a voltage by
using the equation: V = ((input)/1023)*5.


Why do you have to put resistors on the circuit?
They allow us to control the voltage flowing to each color of the LED.
